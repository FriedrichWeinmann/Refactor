# Transform Example Files

This folder contains example transformation files that illustrate the various ways you can apply the predefined token providers.
The actual file-names are arbitrary and all token providers support both psd1 and json formats.
All examples will at least be present in psd1, as those can be commented, allowing for some documentation inside of the file.
